<Directory path> <Old string> <New string>

eg: C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\RenameFiles\RenameFiles.exe "C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\York\Independant Research Project (IRP)\Appendices\Appendix B" B C

In the above example, the code cycles through every file within the "Appendix B" folder, and changes evey instance of the letter "B" to the letter "C".

eg:

Old: "Appendix B.png"
New: "Appendix C.png"
